## Description
Pygame-based mini-game consisting of original art developed in Adobe Photoshop, depicting a player trying to catch falling/"raining" cats and dogs. The game's purpose is to catch cats and dogs until either three are missed and the game ends or the player wins by catching all falling animals.

## Features
- Catch/Miss Logic
	- The catch/miss logic uses surface rectangle collision detection
- Player/Animal Movement
	- Player movement is based on keyboard and/or mouse input to move the player to the catch positions
   	- Animal movement is controlled by algorithm and randomization
- Interface
	- Art is all completely original, i.e. background, animals, player
   	- Scorekeeping and reporting onscreen
   	- Attempts, losses, and wins are displayed
   	- Background music and sound effects 

## Challenges
- Surface association to shapes for collision detection
- Learning to animate a surface using art
- Incorporating sound and music in a game
- Creating and controlling event timers

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- An enjoyable game, that runs smoothly, functions properly, is aesthetically pleasing, and is clear of bugs

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Game runs all functions accurately and is free of bugs
