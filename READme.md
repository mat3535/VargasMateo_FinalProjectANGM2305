## Description
Pygame-based mini-game consisting of original art developed in Adobe Photoshop, depicting a player trying to catch falling/"raining" cats and dogs. The game's purpose is to catch cats and dogs until either three are missed and the game ends or the player wins by catching all falling animals.

Features: 
- Minor "animations"
- 3 misses is a loss
- Game increases in speed gradually as it goes on

Adjustments: 
- Endless playability, game isn't limited to a win count

Future Improvements:
- Cohesive style for game art
- Personally recorded audio
- Smoother movement animations
